# Moving-Maze
A simple game complished by myself.


Actually it was a work from my university.
I think the train of thought is a bit interesting so that I share it in GitHub.

It is just a simple Maze.
However,there exits a level so-called 'Crazy' which allow the maze change itself every few seconds in which way add some difficulties to the game.
